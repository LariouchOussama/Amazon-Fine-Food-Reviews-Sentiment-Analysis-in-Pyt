Sentiment Analysis in Python

### About Dataset

This dataset consists of reviews of fine foods from amazon. The data span a period of more than 10 years, including all ~500,000 reviews up to October 2012. Reviews include product and user information, ratings, and a plain text review. It also includes reviews from all other Amazon categories.

In this notebook we will be doing some sentiment analysis in python using two different techniques:
### 1. VADER (Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner)

Assigns sentiment scores to text based on a pre-built dictionary of words with sentiment values and rules to consider surrounding words for context.

### 2. Roberta Pretrained Model from Hugging Face ðŸ¤—

-Transformer-based, deep learning sentiment analysis model
-Learns to classify text sentiment based on large amounts of pre-trained data, often fine-tuned on specific sentiment analysis tasks.
